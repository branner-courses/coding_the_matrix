## Reference matter

### Videos
I find some videos from the Coursera course have been posted at [benkyoplayer.com](http://benkyoplayer.com/courses/coding-the-matrix-linear-algebra-through-computer-science-applications), accessed 20140103.

### Other on-line courses
Katherine Ye notes another [on-line course on Linear Algebra at U.T. Austin](https://www.edx.org/course/utaustinx/utaustinx-ut-5-01x-linear-algebra-1162), accessed 20140103.

### Other books
Nathan Brei writes:

  * [_Linear algebra and its applications_](http://bookza.org/dl/1023969/eabc38).
  * [_Introduction to linear algebra_](http://bookza.org/dl/919528/46e680). (Slightly slower pace.)

### Miscellaneous

In case it's of interest, you can find a review I wrote of a book about an interesting detail in the history of Linear Algebra on [my website](https://brannerchinese.com/dpb/publications/Branner_Hart_review.pdf).
