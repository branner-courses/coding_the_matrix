## Materials for Self-Study: _Coding the Matrix_

Since January, 2010, I have been registered as a second-degree undergraduate in the Computer Science department of the City College of New York (CCNY). I completed the requirements for the minor in the Fall of 2012, but there are more courses I would like to study, selectively, without necessarily finishing the whole B.S. degree.

One of those courses is Linear Algebra, something very valuable in Computer Science. But CCNY requires Calculus III as a prerequisite to Linear Algebra, and in my current schedule I don't think I can find the time or will to satisfy what seems to me a prerequisite of dubious relevance.

Instead, I have in mind to work seriously through Philip N. Klein's _Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications_, whose first edition was published in November of 2013. Information about the book and other elements of the course are to be found on this website: [codingthematrix.com](http://codingthematrix.com/).

I subscribed to a [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/course/matrix]) based on a subset of this material in the summer of 2013, but I never found the time to do the work. However, I have the videos, slides, and various other material from the course, and I intend to consult it as I work through the book.

### Time

Calc III at CCNY is a five-credit course â€” four credit hours per week of lecture plus one of MATLAB. Faculty in the engineering school always say the same thing I tell my students of Chinese: an hour of class costs some two or three hours of out-of-class time to process. Translation: a five credit course costs ten to fifteen hours of homework a week. So, since I'm doing this course instead of Calc III, my intention is to give it the same amount of time: fifteen to twenty hours a week, including four or five studying the textbook and videos.

### Homework

I intend to post code for the assignments in a directory, `ASSIGNMENTS_DPB/`. If other people choose to work in tandem with me, I hope they will also post their code in their own directories on the same site, similarly named.

### Other

In case it's of interest, you can find a review I wrote of a book about an interesting detail in the history of Linear Algebra on [my website](https://brannerchinese.com/dpb/publications/Branner_Hart_review.pdf).
