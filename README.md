## Self-Study of Linear Algebra

Since January, 2010, I have been registered as a second-degree undergraduate in the Computer Science department of the City College of New York (CCNY). I completed the requirements for the minor in the Fall of 2012, but there are more courses I would like to take, selectively, without necessarily finishing the whole B.S. degree.

One of those courses is Linear Algebra, something very valuable in Computer Science. But CCNY requires Calculus III as a prerequisite to Linear Algebra, and in my current schedule I don't think I can find the time or will to satisfy what seems to me a prerequisite of dubious relevance.

Instead, I have in mind to work seriously through **Philip N. Klein's _Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications_**, whose first edition was published in November of 2013. 

As of 2014.04.07, I have moved all the content to a private repository.
