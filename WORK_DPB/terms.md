## Terms

### Chapter 0

 * function: set of pairs, no two of which share the same first element.
 * image:

  1. a specific output corresponding to a specific input of a function
  1. the set of all images of a function

 * pre-image: a specific input corresponding to a specific output of a function.
 * domain: set of possible inputs.
 * co-domain: set of possibly outputs (may be superset of image).
 * under: like "when serving as argument to": "input maps to output under function". In "f : A -> B", the colon is read "under".
 * map: like "is assigned to": "input maps to output under function".
 * right arrow: read "maps" in "f : A -> B".
 * procedure: "function" in Python coding; use this to avoid confusion with mathematical term "function".
 * not onto: co-domain is superset of image
 * not one-to-one: more than one pre-image maps to the same image.
 * invertible: both one-to-one and onto.
 * Fundamental principle of probability theory: The probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes making up the event.
 * outcome: pre-image of a probability.
 * event: set of outcomes.
 * random: (not defined).
 * filter: condition within a comprehension (Klein's term)
 * disjoint: (of sets) non-overlapping
 * formal argument: (of a "procedure") what we usually call the argument of a Python function
