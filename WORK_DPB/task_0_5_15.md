## Three-element tuple with sum = 0, excluding (0, 0, 0)

    In [1]: S = [-4, -2, 1, 2, 5, 0]
    
    In [2]: [(i, j, k) for i in S for j in S for k in S if sum([i, j, k]) == 0 and (i, j, k) != (0, 0, 0)]
    Out[37]: 
    [(-4, 2, 2),
     (-2, 1, 1),
     (-2, 2, 0),
     (-2, 0, 2),
     (1, -2, 1),
     (1, 1, -2),
     (2, -4, 2),
     (2, -2, 0),
     (2, 2, -4),
     (2, 0, -2),
     (0, -2, 2),
     (0, 2, -2)]

Note that the most accessible `itertools` method does not produce such full results:

    In [3]: import itertools

    In [4]: [i for i in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(S, 3) if sum(i) == 0 and i != (0, 0, 0)] 
    Out[4]: [(-4, 2, 2), (-2, 1, 1), (-2, 2, 0)]

It does not consider all permutations of each tuple. To do that, we need another step:

    In [5]: unpermuted = [i for i in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(S, 3) if sum(i) == 0 and i != (0, 0, 0)]
    
    In [6]: [j for j in itertools.permutations(unpermuted)]
    Out[6]: 
    [((-4, 2, 2), (-2, 1, 1), (-2, 2, 0)),
     ((-4, 2, 2), (-2, 2, 0), (-2, 1, 1)),
     ((-2, 1, 1), (-4, 2, 2), (-2, 2, 0)),
     ((-2, 1, 1), (-2, 2, 0), (-4, 2, 2)),
     ((-2, 2, 0), (-4, 2, 2), (-2, 1, 1)),
     ((-2, 2, 0), (-2, 1, 1), (-4, 2, 2))]

This result, however, includes duplicates. Better to use:
    
    In [7]: permuted = set()
    
    In [8]: unpermuted
    Out[8]: [(-4, 2, 2), (-2, 1, 1), (-2, 2, 0)]
    
    In [9]: permuted.update(i for j in unpermuted for i in itertools.permutations(j))
    
    In [10]: list(permuted)
    Out[10]: 
    [(1, 1, -2),
     (-2, 1, 1),
     (-4, 2, 2),
     (0, 2, -2),
     (2, -2, 0),
     (2, 2, -4),
     (1, -2, 1),
     (0, -2, 2),
     (-2, 0, 2),
     (-2, 2, 0),
     (2, 0, -2),
     (2, -4, 2)]

Confirm that these two solutions are the same:

    In [1]: import itertools
    
    In [2]: S = [-4, -2, 1, 2, 5, 0]
    
    In [3]: permuted = set()
    
    In [4]: unpermuted = [i for i in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(S, 3) if sum(i) == 0 and i != (0, 0, 0)]
    
    In [5]: by_nested = set([(i, j, k) for i in S for j in S for k in S if sum([i, j, k]) == 0 and (i, j, k) != (0, 0, 0)])
    
    In [6]: permuted.update(i for j in unpermuted for i in itertools.permutations(j))
    
    In [7]: permuted == by_nested
    Out[7]: True

As expected, it is faster to use the `itertools` method when three or more loops are involved:
    
    python -m timeit -s """
    import itertools, random
    number = 3
    """ """
    S = [random.randint(-number, number) for i in range(number)]
    permuted = set()
    unpermuted = [i for i in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(S, number) if sum(i) == 0]
    permuted.update(i for j in unpermuted for i in itertools.permutations(j))
    """
    
    # 100000 loops, best of 3: 13.5 usec per loop
    
    python -m timeit -s """
    import itertools, random
    number = 3
    """ """
    S = [random.randint(-number, number) for i in range(number)]
    by_nested = set([(i, j, k) for i in S for j in S for k in S if sum([i, j, k]) == 0])
    """
    
    # 100000 loops, best of 3: 16.8 usec per loop

With more than three loops, nesting is distinctly slower

    python -m timeit -s """
    import itertools, random
    number = 4
    """ """
    S = [random.randint(-number, number) for i in range(number)]
    permuted = set()
    unpermuted = [i for i in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(S, number) if sum(i) == 0]
    permuted.update(i for j in unpermuted for i in itertools.permutations(j))
    """
