## Problems 0.8.6-7

0.8.6: Yes, it is invertible. Enumerating the (pre-image, image) pairs, we can see that the function is both onto and one-to-one.

0.8.7. No, it is not invertible because the domain is a superset of the image. Deleting those elements of the domain not found in the image will make it invertible.
